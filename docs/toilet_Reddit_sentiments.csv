Lift IC,"This happened while I was walking home from work at about 7pm.,

Was walking home on my usual path and there was a girl walking ahead of me by a few metres and we we've been walking the same path for a bit.

She kept turning her head abit to see who's following her and all to the point where it got quite obvious to me, so I took out my phone and used it as it was getting awkward.

After sometime, she stopped to the side and used her phone. I'm pretty sure she was feeling scared so I just walk pass her without looking at her and walked to my block lift which was really close at this point of time. 

Pressed the button to call the lift and while waiting, i realise that she walked towards the lift as well so it was obvious she stays there. 

Lift came, i entered the lift and pressed my floor but she didn't press anything. I knew that she wasn't one of my neighbors, so she's still probably being cautious of me. 

Lift reached my floor so I waited for a milisecond for her to leave the lift as she was standing closer to the exit but she didn't move. So I just walked out without looking back.

I know that she felt cautious of me since we've been walking the same path but man, that hurts like hell. I know i'm very tanned and tall, possibly intimidating but come on she could atleast waited somewhere for me to be out of sight or something. I was prepared to show my IC of where I stay incase she made a scene lol.",positive,0.06,1/10/19,Reddit

In many places here you can find female cleaners in male toilets, but you will never find male cleaners cleaning female toilets, for obvious reasons.

August,"This is actually a psa. This isn't the first time somebody has tried to do such a thing. So I would like to warn you guys and keep an eye out for these kinds of people. 

This just happened, on the 7the August 2019 at around 9.10pm-9.15pm. I live on the first floor in a hdb block in sembawang. I entered to bathe at around 8.50pm, after coming home from school. As I was showering, I heard a sound come from the bathroom window which was open for ventilation purposes. The window was a kind of pane window that those classrooms in secondary school have.

When I looked at the window, I saw a tan hand holding a phone and it was pointing at me. I immediately tried to cover myself and hide away. The shower was far away from the door so I began to panic. I was desperate for him to stop filming/taking pics so I shouted for him to go away. And he did. 

I know I shouldn't have done that but in the moment, I just wanted for him to stop. The phone was a teal/blueish green colour with a big camera in the centre of it. The brand was being covered by his hand. It's an obvious android phone tho. 

This isn't the first time this has happened in my block. My neighbour faced the same thing about a year ago and managed to confront the guy but he ran away.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Got filmed at Heartbeat@Bedok ActiveSG Swimming Complex washroom, confronted the pervert, end up with police.

&#x200B;

This happened on 22/06/2019.

&#x200B;

It was a rainy Saturday and i was at Heartbeat@Bedok ActiveSG Swimming Complex from 3.15ish.

&#x200B;

I went to the male washroom/~~changing room/shower area~~ (*it was a all in one thing, so from now on i am just going to refer to it as the* ***washroom.***) to change into my swimming gear. While i was in the washroom, i saw a man from a bench away. The man who is Chinese have a skin complexion that looks sickly. He was only wearing only a singlet with nothing covering his private parts except a towel. The towel which he remove to expose himself time to time while walking around in a male washroom filled with people ranging from kids to adults. ***\[Point 1\]***

&#x200B;

Nothing happened and fast forward to me back into the washroom for a shower after my swim. The same man was there still doing what he was doing before. I took cubical 13, at the point in time, cubical 12 and 14 which i was in between of was empty.

&#x200B;

While rinsing off shampoo of my hair, i caught a hand holding onto a phone angling with the rear camera facing me underneath the gap of the plastic wall separating cubical 12 and 13. The hand immediately retracted once it was within my vision. Which shocked me, so i took a step to the right to see further in between the gap to find that a towel on the floor of cubical 12. Looking back, i think he was laying on the floor filming/~~taking a photo/streaming/peeping~~ (*i really didn't know what he was doing with the camera but i am just going to say* ***filming*** *cause that was what my account was to the police later.*) of me while i was showering while looking at the phone screen so he knew exactly when to remove his phone. That towel was on a floor for a long time before he picked it up.

&#x200B;

After which i was doubting what i saw but being extra cautious about what happened that may happen again. It happened again while i was rinsing off my body wash so i knew something was up.

&#x200B;

Got out of my cubical, butt ass naked slamming on his door, yelling for the man to get out while calling for my friend to help me. To which i only received dead silence from cubical 12 for a long time, so i took a slipper from his cubical gap, so even if he ran out the CCTV will show that a man walking oddly. Thinking about it after, i sense that he knew shit was up so he went to clear off whatever he was doing. After a long time, he came out revealing to be the same man from before with a long scar from the middle of his chest claiming that he just had heart surgery and denied whatever i said about him filming me. Very willingly offered to me his phone to show that there was nothing on his phone, which i didn't bother with and asked my friend to dial for the police.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to the part where the lifeguard usher me to their office to wait for the police while the man was held in a room elsewhere. The police took notes from me, their investigating officer came. In the end, i got a card with some information as they have deemed this case worth pursuing. ***\[Point 2\]***

\----------------------------------------

# [Point 1]

**Point 1 is just my suspicion of what he was doing, in no way am i able to confirm his actions.**

&#x200B;

The man was cruising for sex in the male washroom. [Read about it here \[Wiki: Slightly NSFW?\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruising_for_sex). You can read the behaviors from [RiceMedia post about it here](https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-two-gay-men-gay-cruising-evolved-between-generations/) or Google about it. There are sites out there that cruisers use. [Such as this \[Slightly NSFW?\]](https://www.blowingwind.io/forum/topic/67705-swimming-pools-complexes-compiled/page/116/). Not the first time such incident happened at [bedok](https://www.allsingaporestuff.com/article/parents-be-careful-perverts-bedok-swimming-complex).

&#x200B;

What i want to point out here is that this isn't the only pool that such stuffs occur. And that pools aren't the only place that cruising happen. A quick Google search about Singapore gay cruising and you can find a bunch of stuff. Another instance, [public toilets \[Slightly NSFW?\]](http://singaporestories.com/gay-cruising-and-clubs-in-singapore.html).

&#x200B;

I am not saying that only cruisers enjoy voyeurism or that eliminating cruisers would have prevented filming cases. But if actions were taken on it, i could say that my case could have been easily prevented.

&#x200B;

# [Point 2]

&#x200B;

With the investigations on going, i can only think about [NTU peeping tom](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/19-year-old-man-investigated-ntu-male-toilet-shower-11475234), Monica Baey and [the Tampines incident which the offender only got 12 weeks of jail](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/man-jailed-for-taking-videos-of-women-in-tampines-toilet).

&#x200B;

Looking at how "" ['Insulting modesty' law does not apply to men, rules court](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/insulting-modesty-law-does-not-apply-to-men-rules-court) "". I only can think about how the man who filmed me may get a lighter sentence cause i am a male or even no sentence if the police found no evidence on his phone.

&#x200B;

\----------------------------------------

&#x200B;

If you read it all to the end, do take action if your feel something was wrong. Call for help, take evidence if you are able to, better yet confront. Cause if you have nothing, the offender got away or police can't find the deleted evidence, it is he said she said.

&#x200B;

Sure you can be cautious but doesn't mean it wouldn't happen to you. This is Singapore but it doesn't mean you are safe. You maybe a man but that doesn't mean you aren't a target. May not be a person with a phone but a hidden camera.

&#x200B;

Honestly, it was scary to take actions and confront the man who was filming me. But luckily, i felt sick to my gut and i let my anger took over and went batshit violent on the door of cubical 12, not to condone actions taken in anger but if i were to held back, he could have easily slip off.

&#x200B;

I am not going to argue how the law should be equal with men and women or about how disturbing it is about cruising, cause honestly i am not even at the age where i can vote yet. But that doesn't mean preying on the young means you can get away with it. I do however, feel things should change.

Soon Nicholas Lim Peeping Tom Ms Monica Baey Mr Lim National University Singapore NUS Straits Times Drunk Mr Lim Leisure Park Kallang Thursday Ms Baey November Mr Lim Mr Lim Mr Lim Great Eastern Singapore Monday Mr Lim Mr Lim Mr Lim Eusoff Hall Mr Lim NUS Mr Lim Monica,"Link to article here - https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/no-excuse-it-was-very-wrong-nicholas-lim

Soon after undergraduate Nicholas Lim took a video of someone in the hostel shower on his phone, he confessed the act to his girlfriend.
The girlfriend was also on her phone: She had received a message that there was a Peeping Tom on the university campus. Together, they met Ms Monica Baey so he could own up and apologise.

""I wanted to confess it was me,"" Mr Lim, 23, a chemical engineering student at the National University of Singapore (NUS), told The Straits Times.

Asked if he did so only out of fear that he would be caught as a result of his image being captured by surveillance cameras, he said no.
""I did something wrong. I wasn't planning to hide from it, to run.""

In his first media interview, the man at the centre of a high-profile sexual misconduct case that has prompted widespread discussion about how such incidents are handled on university campuses said, when asked how the past week had been for him:
""I don't think I am a victim. I'm the perpetrator. I did what I did. My point is not to justify my action. Not to say I was drunk. Drunk or not, it should never have happened.""

At turns emotional, Mr Lim, who was accompanied by a male friend at the interview at a coffee joint at Leisure Park Kallang, said that he is now going public because he wanted people to know ""how truly sorry I am"".

He broke down twice - burying his head in his arms, his voice trembling - especially when talking about the impact the saga has had on his parents. At one point, his friend patted his arm.

Last Thursday, Ms Baey posted on social media about the incident which took place last November, and her anguish about the lack of steps taken to penalise Mr Lim.
He did not know how to react after reading it, he said.

""I was worried, scared. Then came the media coverage. Everyone was posting online.""
It was then that he told his parents about the incident which happened.

The following morning, his 83-year-old grandmother died from a heart attack. It was not from the incident, he clarified.

But it was painful seeing how much hurt he has caused his parents who, at the same time, had to prepare for his grandmother's wake. ""My parents were very worried and kept asking if I was okay. As a son, the last thing I want is for them to be so worried about me at their age, when I should be the one taking care of them,"" said Mr Lim, the only son of a taxi driver, 69, and a housewife, 59.

""They now have to bear this uncertainty with me,"" he said, referring to his future.

Mr Lim had joined insurer Great Eastern Singapore as a financial adviser last year while still a student. The company suspended him on Monday, and he later submitted his resignation.

""My dad is a taxi driver and he works very hard. I can tell he is worried sick,"" said Mr Lim.
""There were definitely moments where I felt I could no longer hold it together, but I was lucky to have the support and encouragement of my family, friends and even strangers who have kept me going.

""They were angry at what I did. They were also willing to let me redeem myself - had the faith and belief in the person that I am, to be able to learn from my mistake and become a better person.""

His girlfriend, whom he declined to name, has also chosen to stand by him, he said.

Other than going to his grandmother's wake, Mr Lim spent most of his time at home. ""For me to step out of the house is not easy. I am worried over what's out there and how people would perceive me.""

Mr Lim insisted he does not know what came over him that night. The touch rugby player had gone out to celebrate the end of season with his club mates.

His friend sent him to Eusoff Hall, where he had planned to sleep over in his girlfriend's hostel room.

But as he was walking to the male toilet to take a shower, he passed the female toilet and heard someone in the shower.

""The thought came and I did what I did. It was a hasty decision. I didn't know who was inside. I wasn't dead drunk,"" said Mr Lim.

He insisted he does not know what came over him.

""I have no excuse why I did it, alcohol is no reason. It was very wrong. I am deeply remorseful. I have and will continue to seek counselling and help,"" he said.

A key issue heavily debated the past week has been NUS' ""two strikes"" policy, as well as the police's decision to let him off with a conditional warning.

On whether he felt he should have been charged, Mr Lim said he was not in a position to say if his punishment has been fair or unfair. But it is something he has to deal with.

""I hope that through this incident, there will be fewer occurrences of such offences, whether due to social media presence or by review of systems and regulations to formulate deterrent measures.""

Much of the public anger was also fuelled by speculation that he had got off lightly because he had influential parents.

He said: ""I hope that people realise the power and impact of social media, and use it for the good of the society. That being said, I am in no position to claim what is fair or not, nor right or wrong. I personally hope that nobody else, along with their loved ones, would have to go through the scrutiny and shaming we did. I would not wish that upon my worst enemy.

He added: ""I want to say that I have been and still am truly sorry for what I have done. Nobody should ever be put through the kind of trauma that I caused Monica. People have condemned me and my actions - I deserve it. I condemn myself. I seek everyone's forgiveness.

""And I resolve to work on becoming a better person; to be someone that my parents will not ever be ashamed of in the future.""",positive,0.002363372,1/10/19,Reddit
